## Design Decisions  
As one of core XP Values was Respect, we wanted to play on each others strengths, so we chose components based on that philosophy:    
-Front End: React, It allowed for us to learn about a language that is widely used, and works well in deployment  
-Back End: Java Script, It connects well with both the DB and the Front-end  
-Database: Relational Database, We know the data that is going to be stored, so it helps reduce the complexity of the Database
